# ExaMode Colon cancer Entity Recognition Tool : CERT

ExaMode CERT allows the user to extract both the entities and concepts from user-provided medical reports. At the moment the system supports English only, but other languages are planned to be supported soon. The generated RDF reports can be exported with the following file formats:

- N3
- NQUADS
- RDF
- TURTLE

The concepts extracted are provided using the JSON file format.

The diagnosis field, where the user is supposed to provide the medical report text, supports spellchecking to minimize typos.
